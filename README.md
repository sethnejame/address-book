# Address Book Challenge, Week 2 - Seth, Erik & Julie

The address book is a web app that allows you to store a list of contacts via localStorage in the web browser.  The UI is styled with a combination of custom CSS and Semanti UI.  See below for a list of references.

### Usage
1. Click the "Add Contact" from to open a drop down form.  Fill in the drop down form with the desired information.
2. When you're finished, click the "Save Contact" button at the bottom of the form.  This will populate an address book below the form where you can view all your contacts.
3. If you wish to remove a contact, simply click on the "Delete" button under each contact card.
4. The "modify" button is currently under development.
